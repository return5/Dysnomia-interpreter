## major work in progress:   

This is an attempt to make a dedicated interpreter for my hobby programming language [project dysnomia](https://github.com/return5/Project-Dysnomia)  
That project was using a simpler text replacer which would simply replace dysnomaia code with equivalent lua code which would then get ran through lua's interpreter.   
This is an attempt to create a standalone interpreter for it and to also further develop the language.
